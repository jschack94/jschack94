# Hi there, I'm Jonathan Schack 👋🏻

I am a full stack web developer and life-long learner with a formal education in marketing and sales. Initially a hobby, my interest in web development quickly transformed into a full-blown passion, leading me to a multitude of technologies including Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React. Because of Flatiron School, I have been propelled into a fresh career path that I am extremely excited to learn and grow in. My latest web app allows mentees to collaborate with professionals in their field; I am fascinated by creating applications that connect likeminded people from all over the world.

⚡ Fun fact: In the past year: I followed my passion to building fully-functioning applications and traveled to Thailand by myself!

🌱 I’m currently developing in Javascript and React

## Current Projects <br/>
> ⭐️ [JonathanCodes] I'm rebuilding my portfolio to modernize and simplify the code structure with React and Gatsby.

>💡 [In The Wav] I am working with Spotify's API. Work in Progress!
